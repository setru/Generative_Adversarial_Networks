# Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an approach to generative modeling based on deep learning methods.

The standard problem settings for GANs are generation of photorealistic images and image-to-image translation tasks (translating photos of summer to winter, day to night etc.).

As GANs still do have certain limitations about generating large images, the task is decomposed into two: first, use a simple GAN to generate a bunch of low resolution images from noise, then upscale them using another generative model.
